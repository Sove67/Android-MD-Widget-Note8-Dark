# Markdown Widget
A minimalistic widget with the content of a markdown file to your home screen, forked from [here](https://github.com/Tiim/Android-Markdown-Widget).
This app is intended for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), but should display any .md file
saved using CommonMark formatting. It may also partially function with other formats.

## Features
* Open any markdown or text file on your phone and display it as an home screen widget.
* The widget is updated in a regular, 30 minute interval, and anytime the user configures it.
* Transparent Note Background
* White Text designed for dark wallpapers
* Scrolling
* Note Title
* Purple Highlighting
* Prefix Formatting
  * Headers 1 - 3
  * Bullet Lists
  * Checkboxes (Non Interactive)
  * Enumerated Lists up to 9 entries long

Currently the widget is non-interactive. Tapping on links or checkboxes does not do anything.

## Planned Features
* Checkbox Interaction
  * Parent Reacts to child completion
* Checkbox Colouration
* Inline formatting
  * Italics
  * Bolding
  * strikethrough
  * Links
* View File In Obsidian when title is tapped
* Reactive Widget Updates
